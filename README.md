## 👨‍💻Problem solved by this project
India is a beautiful country. The diversity in this country is incredible. Even then, many smaller countries attract more foreign tourists than India. But why? Why can't we bring people to show them our amazing country? The answer could be simple, BRANDING.
India is the most beautiful country in the world ,the Himalayan mountains beaches of Kerala the desert of Rajasthan. what doesn't India have??  just one thing tourist.
Dubai is a City but 16.9 million tourists come to Dubai every year but in India as a country have  only 10 million that's it. 
and this impacts our hotels and our businesses and our economy. The country is ours and if we want to become a superpower we need to grow our economy.
That’s why I present you this amazing project named India Aura.
